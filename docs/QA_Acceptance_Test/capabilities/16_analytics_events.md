# Capability: Analytics Events (PostHog)

> Asserts that product analytics actually arrive in PostHog with the canonical
> schema (`docs/analytics.md`). Exists to catch regressions like the 2026-08
> incident where MCP tool calls were captured under the legacy `mcp_tool_call`
> name, so PostHog's MCP views showed "MCP tool call (legacy)" with no tool name.

## How to query

Preferred: the session's **PostHog MCP connector** (decision 2026-08-23 —
option 2 of the key-provisioning discussion on PR #78). Runners inherit the
session's MCP connections: load the tool via ToolSearch (keyword `posthog
exec`; the server prefix is a connector UUID, so never hardcode the full tool
name) and run read-only HogQL via `call execute-sql {"query": …}`. The
`qa-env-runner` agent definition allowlists this tool. Cite "via PostHog MCP"
in evidence.

Fallback: `npx tsx scripts/qa-posthog-events.ts` (read-only HogQL probe; see
its header for flags). It requires `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY` (Query:Read
scope) and `POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID` in the environment or `.env.local` — **these
are deliberately unprovisioned as of 2026-08-23**; the script becomes the
primary path for cloud/CI sessions only if Ken provisions the keys later.

Prerequisites and caveats:

- If NEITHER path is available (ToolSearch finds no PostHog tool — possible in
  cloud/CI sessions where the interactively-authenticated connector is absent,
  and the keys are unprovisioned), every assertion below is a `skip` with
  reason "no PostHog query path in this session" — never a pass.
- All three Vercel environments share one PostHog project. **Always filter on
  the `environment` property** matching the deployment under test:
  `development` (localhost), `preview` (`*.vercel.app`), `production`.
- Ingestion lags ~30–60s. Re-query at least twice over ~2 minutes before
  calling an expected event missing.
- Evidence masking: the script truncates distinct ids; never paste a full Clerk
  user id, email, or key into qa-results.json or anything public.

## Assertions

Run these AFTER the environment's other capabilities (they generate the tool
calls under inspection). Use `--since` spanning the run so counts are
attributable to it.

### A8: Response-size monitoring props on every tool call
- Inspect `$mcp_tool_call` events across services (gmail, sheets, docs tools)
  from this run.
- **Expected**: Every event carries `response_chars` and `response_kb`
  (monitoring-only — plan google-docs-support v5, D7: no size caps are
  enforced; the props exist so PostHog can measure how often responses exceed
  MCP clients' tool-result budgets). `gmail_get_attachment` additionally
  carries `attachment_chars`/`attachment_kb` on every outcome that reaches
  the attachment fetch, including the over-cap ⚠️ refusal — which since
  2026-08-24 classifies as `outcome=size_capped`, not `failed` (first shipped
  with the raw-api-classification change — earlier docs described these props
  ahead of the code). Events whose attachment fetch itself failed carry
  `attachment_declared_kb` (size from the parent's MIME metadata) instead —
  but only when the intended attachment is identifiable from the fresh
  parent read: filename-selected fetches, current-id fetches, and the
  single-attachment self-heal (`attachment_selfheal` `recovered`/
  `retry_failed`, which resolves the caller's stale id to the message's
  only attachment and stamps its declared size). The `ambiguous` and
  `no_attachments` branches cannot name a target attachment, so a null
  declared size there is correct, not a regression (2026-09-02 finding:
  before this the heal branch stamped nothing either, making the fallback
  black-box unreachable).
  Windowed reads (`gmail_get_attachment`, `docs_read_document`) add
  `window_offset` / `window_chars` / `window_total_chars` — asserted in
  capability 20 (A6), not re-checked here.

### A9: Raw Google API calls carry product/action classification
- Inspect `$mcp_tool_call` events where `$mcp_tool_name` is `google_api_get`
  or `google_api_modify` from this run (capability 10 generates them: a raw
  Gmail read, a raw Sheets call, and an unknown-family passthrough).
- **Expected**: every such event carries `raw_api_kind` (one of `sheets`,
  `sheets_create`, `docs`, `docs_create`, `gmail_read`, `gmail_send`,
  `gmail_draft_send`, `gmail_write`, `passthrough`, `denied`),
  `raw_api_mutating`, and `raw_api_endpoint` whose
  value is the HTTP method plus an **id-stripped** path template — it must
  contain `{id}`/`{range}` placeholders where the call used real identifiers
  and must NOT contain any actual spreadsheet/message/document id.
  `raw_api_family` is present on every non-denied event (`gmail`,
  `spreadsheets`, `documents`, or the passthrough family); denied events
  carry `denial_code` instead.

### A10: Google failure reason and account-resolution reason are recorded
- Inspect `$mcp_tool_call` events from this run whose `outcome` is `error` or
  `failed`.
- **Expected**:
  - Every `outcome=error` event carries `error_status`. Events whose Google
    response body included an error reason additionally carry `error_reason`
    (Google's `error.errors[0].reason`, e.g. `rateLimitExceeded`,
    `insufficientPermissions`, `domainPolicy`) and, when present,
    `error_domain` (e.g. `usageLimits`). Absent reasons are legitimate — some
    Google errors carry no `errors[]` — so assert "present when the body had
    one", not "always present".
  - No `error_reason` / `error_domain` value contains an email, message id,
    spreadsheet id, or any other identifier: these must only ever be Google's
    enum strings.
  - Every `outcome=failed` event produced by account/token resolution carries
    `failure_reason`, one of `no_proxy_key`, `no_accessible_accounts`,
    `account_not_permitted`, `google_token_unavailable`. Capability 03
    (multi-email scoping) and 07 (key lifecycle) generate the
    `account_not_permitted` and `no_proxy_key` cases respectively.
  - Since the directory-error demotion (PR #72 salvage, 2026-09), a second
    class of `outcome=failed` events exists: user/caller-fixable Google
    results demoted from `error` — the not-picked sheet/doc 403/404
    setup-link guidance (`fileGrantErrorResult`), the stale Gmail
    message-id/attachment-id 404 guidance (`gmailNotFoundResult`), and the
    stale-comment 404 guidance (`commentsErrorResult`). These carry
    `error_status` (NOT `failure_reason`); a run where they classify as
    `outcome=error` is a regression. Genuine unhealth (5xx, `timeout`,
    `network`, throttling 403, exceptions) must still classify `error`.
  - `outcome=failed` events must still have `$mcp_is_error = false`. These
    are deliberately `textResult`, not `errorResult` — promoting them would
    move them into the error field Anthropic's Connector Directory reads. A
    run where `$mcp_is_error` is true for a `failed` outcome is a regression,
    not a pass.
  - A `gmail_get_attachment` or `gmail_read` event with `error_status = 404`
    carries `gmail_404_site` (`message` or `attachment`). `attachment` means
    the parent message read succeeded and only the attachment id was stale.
    (Since the demotion these rows classify `outcome=failed`, not `error`.)

### A1: Canonical tool-call events arrive with tool names
- Run: `npx tsx scripts/qa-posthog-events.ts --event '$mcp_tool_call' --since <run window> --environment <tier>`
- **Expected**: `row_count` ≥ the number of MCP tool calls this run made;
  `missing_tool_name` is 0; `by_tool` lists the tools actually called
  (e.g. `gmail_send`, `get_my_permissions`) with plausible counts

### A2: No legacy-named events are emitted
- Run the same query with `--event mcp_tool_call` (legacy name, no `$`)
- **Expected**: `row_count` is 0 for the run window in this environment —
  nothing in the deployed code still captures the legacy event

### A3: Outcome taxonomy is recorded
- Inspect `by_outcome` from A1 (ensure the run included at least one allowed
  call and one policy-denied call, e.g. capability 01 A1 + A2)
- **Expected**: at least one `success` and at least one `denied_by_policy`;
  every outcome value is within {success, denied_by_policy, pending_approval,
  size_capped, failed, error, exception}

### A4: Events attribute to the Clerk user, not anonymous
- Inspect `rows[].distinct_id` from A1
- **Expected**: rows from this run's authenticated calls have a Clerk-style
  distinct id (masked, `user_…` prefix) — the same person the dashboard
  identifies — and none attribute to `anonymous-mcp`

### A5: Environment tagging matches the deployment tier
- Compare A1 run with and without the `--environment` filter over the run window
- **Expected**: every row from this run carries the correct `environment` value
  for the base URL under test (localhost → `development`, `*.vercel.app` →
  `preview`, `fgac.ai` → `production`); the filtered and unfiltered counts of
  this run's events match

### A6: Sign-up CTA event fires (browser environments)
- Signed out, load the landing page and click a sign-up CTA (do NOT complete
  sign-up — never create accounts); then
  `npx tsx scripts/qa-posthog-events.ts --event sign_up_started --since 10 --environment <tier>`
- **Expected**: ≥ 1 row with `cta_location` ∈ {nav, hero, bottom_cta}.
  Headless environments (no browser) `skip` with that reason.
  (`sign_up_completed` is deliberately untested — it requires creating a real
  account, which QA never does; it is validated implicitly by the Clerk
  webhook's own tests.)

### A7: Demo video play event fires (browser environments)
- Load the landing page and start playback on one of the Descript demo
  embeds — click its play control; if the embed ignores automated clicks,
  trigger playback from the page console instead
  (`document.querySelector('iframe[src*="share.descript.com"]').contentWindow.postMessage(JSON.stringify({context:'player.js',version:'0.0.11',method:'play'}),'*')`
  — this still exercises FGAC's listener + capture path end-to-end); then
  `npx tsx scripts/qa-posthog-events.ts --event video_played --since 10 --environment <tier>`
- **Expected**: ≥ 1 row whose `video_id` matches the embed and whose `page`
  is `/` (or the use-case page); exactly one event per video per page load
  regardless of subsequent pause/resume. Headless environments `skip`.

### A14: The approval funnel joins on a deterministic request_id
- Trigger the same denial three times (capability 14 A12), then approve the
  link once. Query the three approval events for the affected user:
  `SELECT event, properties.request_id, properties.action, count() FROM events
   WHERE event LIKE 'approval_link_%' AND timestamp >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
   GROUP BY 1,2,3`
- **Expected**: All three mint attempts carry the **same** `request_id`, and
  the `approval_link_opened` / `approval_link_approved` rows carry that same
  id — a single request joins across all three stages. `uniq(request_id)` = 1
  while `count()` on minted = 3
- **Regression**: before 2026-08-25 `link_id` was a per-mint JWT `jti`, so
  retries were indistinguishable from fresh demand. That is what made a funnel
  converting near 58% report as 31%

### A11: Mint events count attempts, not requests
- From the same three denials, inspect `mint_count` on the minted events and
  the `approval_requests` row
- **Expected**: `approval_link_minted` fires **once per attempt** (3 events),
  and the `approval_requests` row for that `request_id` has `mint_count` = 3
  with one `first_minted_at`. Demand (rows) stays separable from retry
  pressure (`mint_count`) — a funnel that collapses retries into one event
  would lose the retry signal entirely

### A12: Approval events carry no raw customer identifiers
- Inspect the properties of every `approval_link_*` event from the run
- **Expected**: `target_hash` is present for targeted actions and is a hash —
  it must NOT equal, contain, or reveal the spreadsheet id, document id, or
  recipient address. No raw file id, recipient address, or FGAC user id
  appears in any approval-event property, and none appears in the approval URL

### A13: Approve-page opens distinguish agents from people
- Open an approval link in the browser, then fetch the same URL with a
  non-browser user agent (an authenticated agent-style client)
- **Expected**: Both produce `approval_link_opened`; the browser open has
  `agent_driven: false` and the agent-style fetch has `agent_driven: true`
- **Why**: the event is captured server-side and carries no browser UA of its
  own, so every open previously looked identical. ~23% of production
  approve-page loads were an AI agent rather than a person, which meant
  "opened" systematically overstated human reach. Report approvals, not opens

### A15: rule_saved carries via and file_id for rule creation
- Create a Gmail rule via the dashboard's manual rule form (the modal is
  Gmail-only today), AND create a sheets (or docs) rule for a hand-typed
  never-picked fixture id through the app's own grant seam — as the
  signed-in user, `POST /api/rules/grant-sheets-access` with
  `{targetResourceId, resourceName, actionType}` (the same call the Picker
  manager makes; the same action capability 17 A10 exercises — one creation
  serves both). Then query `rule_saved` events for the run window
  (`npx tsx scripts/qa-posthog-events.ts --event rule_saved --since <run
  window> --environment <tier>`, or the PostHog MCP connector).
- **Expected**: the Gmail creation yields a row with
  `via = 'dashboard_manual'`, `mode = 'create'`, correct
  `service`/`action_type`; the grant-seam creation yields a row with
  `via = 'grant_api'`, `mode = 'create'`, and `file_id` equal to the typed
  id (re-POSTing the same id yields `mode = 'update'`). No row carries a
  `regexPattern`/pattern text property — only `pattern_kind`/
  `pattern_length` shape props ever leave the server. (The
  `dashboard_picker` and `magic_link` `via` values are generated by
  capabilities 09/19 and 14/17 respectively; when this run executed those,
  spot-check one row each — `dashboard_picker` rows carry `profile_scoped`,
  `magic_link` rows carry `request_id`.)

### A16: Per-file tool calls carry file_id and file_service
- Inspect the `$mcp_tool_call` events from this run's sheets/docs tool calls
  (capabilities 09/17/19 generate them — e.g. `sheets_read_range`,
  `docs_read_document`, `comments_read`, and a raw per-file `google_api_get`).
- **Expected**: every such event — denied and failed outcomes included —
  carries `file_id` (the spreadsheet/document id the call targeted) and
  `file_service` (`sheets`/`docs`), stamped in `checkFilePermission`. The
  `file_id` on a successful call matches the `file_id` on the `rule_saved`
  row that exposed the file (A15) — the join the per-file
  time-to-first-success funnel depends on. Gmail tool events carry neither
  prop.

### A17: Not-picked-file calls classify failed, not error, and keep error_status
- With a rule-covered-but-never-picked file (the capability 17 A7 state),
  call `sheets_get_spreadsheet` (or a docs read) via MCP; inspect that
  `$mcp_tool_call` event.
- **Expected**: `outcome = 'failed'` with `$mcp_is_error = false` — the ❌
  setup-link guidance text is a textResult, demoted out of the field
  Anthropic's Connector Directory reads — while the event still carries
  `error_status` (403 or 404 from Google) for internal observability, and no
  `failure_reason` (that prop is account-resolution's). A row classifying
  `outcome = 'error'` for this call is the pre-demotion regression. Genuine
  unhealth must be unaffected: any 5xx/`timeout`/`network` row from this run
  still classifies `error` with `$mcp_is_error = true`.

### A18: Reconnect funnel closes with a terminal event
- As a signed-in user whose Google grant is healthy, load
  `/dashboard/accounts?reconnected=1` directly (no real consent round-trip
  needed — the return leg runs on the param alone).
- **Expected**: `google_reconnect_returned` fires when the page processes the
  param, then `google_reconnect_verified` once the tokeninfo poll confirms
  both scopes (with a broken grant it fires `google_reconnect_incomplete
  {missing_scopes}` instead — either terminal event closes the funnel). A
  `google_reconnect_started` with NO subsequent `returned` is the alertable
  signature for abandoned consent or a session dropped during the OAuth
  round-trip (monitoring.md §7.8); a run where the return leg fires neither
  terminal event is a regression.

### A19: Google token failures classify by cause and name who must reconnect
- Inspect `$mcp_tool_call` events from this run with
  `failure_reason = 'google_token_unavailable'` or `'delegation_inactive'`,
  and any `google_token_retry` rows. (Inducing a Clerk-side token failure on
  demand is not possible with the QA accounts — see the A10 evidence note —
  so this assertion is satisfied by the absence of regressions on the rows
  that do occur, plus `npx tsx scripts/test-google-token-failure.ts`, which
  pins the per-class wording.)
- **Expected** (since 2026-09-04):
  - `google_token_unavailable` rows carry `google_token_error` (`no_token` /
    `refresh_failed` / `clerk_error` / `timeout`) and the outcome follows the
    cause: `no_token` / `refresh_failed` classify `denied_by_policy` with
    `denial_code: 'google_token_unavailable'` (🚫 text that says STOP and
    names who must reconnect — for a delegated mailbox, the OWNER signed in as
    that account); `clerk_error` / `timeout` classify `failed` (❌ text that
    says retry ONCE before offering the reconnect link). A `no_token` or
    `refresh_failed` row classifying `failed`, or a `clerk_error` row
    classifying `denied_by_policy`, is a regression.
  - `delegation_inactive` rows (access row present, delegation no longer
    active) classify `failed` with re-delegate guidance and NO reconnect link.
  - A call whose first Clerk fetch failed and whose single server-side retry
    succeeded carries `google_token_retry: 'recovered'` on a `success` row and
    fires NO `google_token_fetch_failed`; `retry_failed` accompanies a final
    failure, whose standalone event carries `retried: true` and, when Clerk
    threw an API error, `clerk_status` / `clerk_code`. `google_token_fetch_failed`
    also fires for `reason = 'no_token'` (it did not before this date).
  - `error_reason` stays absent on every token-layer row — it is the
    Google-response property and the token layer never reached Google.
