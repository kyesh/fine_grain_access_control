# Capability: Magic-Link Approvals (Actionable Denials)

> Phase C of `connector-growth_v1.md`. Send and Sheets denials carry a signed
> deep link that pre-fills the fix; the owning user approves in one click at
> the moment of need. Links are **signed and deterministic**: the same request
> always produces the same URL, so a retrying agent re-emits one link rather
> than minting a new one each time. Links **do not expire and are not
> single-use** (2026-08-25 change). Authorization is the owning user's Clerk
> session plus a live proxy-key ownership check — an agent can mint the
> request, only the human can approve; the HMAC exists to prevent forgery, not
> to authorize. Re-opening a link whose grant is still active is a success
> ("Already approved"). Re-approving after the grant was revoked is
> **permitted** — the URL is permanent by design, and re-granting requires the
> owner's session plus an explicit click on a page naming the grant, the same
> bar as re-adding the rule in the dashboard. Read-block denials deliberately
> carry NO link. Sheets approvals run picker-first when Google lacks a grant
> for the sheet — see capability 17; grant repair is capability 18 (google
> reconnect).

> A9/A10 still describe the outgoing JWT-based link. Do not treat those as
> regressions before that PR lands: record A12/A13 as `skip` with

## Assertions

### A1: Send denial includes pre-filled approval links for both scopes
- With no matching whitelist entry, call `gmail_send` to `USER_B_EMAIL`
- **Expected**: Denial text includes TWO approval URLs on the FGAC origin —
  one granting just the denied recipient, one enabling sending to ANY
  recipient on the profile — with the message presenting them as
  alternatives; nothing is sent

### A2: Approving a send link grants exactly the requested recipient
- Open the A1 link in a browser signed in as the owning user; approve
- **Expected**: A confirmation UI naming the recipient and agent before any
  change; after approval, a whitelist rule for that recipient exists (visible
  in `get_my_permissions` and the dashboard), scoped to that profile; the
  agent's retried `gmail_send` succeeds. No other recipients became sendable

### A3: Sheets denial link pre-fills the spreadsheet and offers RO/RW
- Call `sheets_read_range` on an unexposed spreadsheet; open the denial link
  as the owning user
- **Expected**: Approval UI shows the spreadsheet (id and, where resolvable,
  name) with an explicit Read-only vs Read & Write choice. When Google
  already grants the sheet, approval is one click; when it does not, the
  Picker pick comes first (capability 17 A2/A4). After approving Read-only,
  the retried read succeeds and a write still fails

### A5: Another user's session cannot approve
- Open a USER_A denial link in a browser session signed in as USER_B
- **Expected**: Rejected — no rule is created on either account

### A6: Unauthenticated click requires the owner's sign-in
- Open a valid link in a signed-out browser
- **Expected**: Sign-in is required first; after signing in as the owning
  user the approval proceeds (signing in as anyone else hits A5 behavior)

### A7: Tampered links are rejected
- Modify one character of the link's signature or its recipient parameter
- **Expected**: Rejected as invalid; nothing is created

### A8: Read-block denials carry no magic link
- Trigger a label- or content-blocked `gmail_read` denial
- **Expected**: The restriction message contains no approval URL — weakening
  a read block remains a deliberate dashboard act

### A9: Approval URLs are well-formed single-line links
- Capture approval URLs from (a) a send denial, (b) a sheets denial, and
  (c) `request_access`'s structured `approvalUrl` field
- **Expected**: Each URL contains no whitespace or newline characters
  anywhere in the string, and parses to the FGAC origin with path
  `/dashboard/approve` and a non-empty `token` query parameter
- **Regression**: 2026-08-15 tester finding — a trailing newline in the env
  base URL shipped links as `https://fgac.ai\n/dashboard/...`, breaking the
  entire approval loop

### A10: Denial-minted tokens match the access level the operation needs
- Decode the JWT payload (base64url, no verification needed) of the approval
  link from each denied call in this matrix:
  | Denied operation | Sheet state | Required token action |
  |---|---|---|
  | `sheets_read_range` | unexposed | `sheets_expose` |
  | `sheets_update_range` | unexposed | `sheets_write` |
  | `sheets_append_rows` | unexposed | `sheets_write` |
  | `sheets_update_range` | exposed Read Only | `sheets_write` |
  | `google_api_modify` (Sheets PUT) | unexposed | `sheets_write` |
- **Expected**: The token's `action` claim equals the required action in
  every row — a write denial must never mint a read-level (`sheets_expose`)
  token, which would send the user through an approval that cannot satisfy
  the retried operation
- **Regression**: 2026-08-15 tester finding — write denials minted
  `sheets_expose`, creating an approve→retry→fail loop with no signal

### A11: Approving the send-to-anyone link enables all recipients
- From an A1 denial, open the ANY-recipient link signed in as the owning
  user; approve
- **Expected**: The confirmation UI states sending to ANY recipient from
  every mailbox on the profile is being granted; after approval a
  "Send to Anyone" rule (pattern `*`) is assigned to the profile;
  `gmail_send` to arbitrary addresses succeeds; and the grant is removable
  from the dashboard rules

### A12: Repeating a denial re-emits the same URL
- Trigger the identical denial three times in a row (e.g. call
  `sheets_read_range` on the same unexposed spreadsheet, from the same
  profile, three times); capture the approval URL from each response
- **Expected**: All three URLs are **byte-identical**. A retrying agent
  re-emits one link instead of minting a fresh one per attempt, so the user
  sees one thing to click and `approval_link_minted` counts attempts against
  a single stable `request_id`
- **Regression**: 2026-08 launch cohort — every denial minted a new signed
  token, so one access request produced ~1.45 distinct URLs on average
  (worst observed: 17). Analytics counted those as separate unopened
  requests, reporting a 31% approval rate for a funnel actually converting
  near 58%

### A13: Links do not expire
- Approve a link minted well beyond the retired TTL window (>30 minutes old;
  an hours-old or day-old link is a stronger check)
- **Expected**: The link still resolves and approves normally. No "Link
  expired" card renders in any path, and no denial text, approve-page footer,
  or `request_access` response promises an expiry window

### A14: Re-opening an approved link is idempotent
- Open and approve a link, then open the very same URL again while the grant
  is still active; then click Approve a second time
- **Expected**: Both the re-open and the second approve render "Already
  approved" (success tone, no destructive action) and write nothing — no
  duplicate rule, no second grant. The state is resolved at page LOAD from
  live grant state, not after clicking Approve
- **Note**: This is the one property retained from the retired A4. Re-approval
  after the grant has been **revoked** is deliberately permitted (the URL is
  permanent by design) and is intentionally not asserted here
