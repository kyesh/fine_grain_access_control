# Capability: Raw Google API Pair (Allow-by-Default)

> Covers the `google_api_get` / `google_api_modify` MCP tools that replaced
> `raw_google_api_call` for Anthropic Connectors Directory compliance
> (no single tool may mix safe and unsafe HTTP methods). Classification lives
> in `src/app/api/mcp/googleApiPolicy.ts`; enforcement must be identical to
> the dedicated tools. Hosted-MCP interface only (the REST proxy at
> `/api/proxy` is a separate surface).
>
> Posture (2026-08-30): Gmail writes are ALLOW-BY-DEFAULT — anything the
> gmail.modify grant can do is forwarded and stamped for analytics. The gates
> that remain: sending rides the recipient whitelist (messages/send AND
> drafts/send), settings writes are refused with an honest missing-scope
> reason, and permanent deletion (batchDelete) is never available.

## Assertions

### A1: Raw pair is annotated; legacy tool is gone; descriptions state the real access model
- Call `tools/list` on the hosted MCP endpoint
- **Expected**: `google_api_get` present with `readOnlyHint: true`;
  `google_api_modify` present with `destructiveHint: true`; every listed tool
  has a `title`; `raw_google_api_call` is absent; `google_api_modify`'s input
  schema offers only POST/PUT/PATCH (no DELETE, no GET)
- **Also expected** (description accuracy, 2026-08-15 tester finding):
  `google_api_get` and `gmail_read` descriptions state that Gmail reads are
  allowed by default and filtered by read-block rules (not that every
  response is rule-gated), and `gmail_get_attachment`'s description states
  the returned data is base64url-encoded (URL-safe alphabet, padded — a
  15,326-byte fixture ends in exactly one "=", verified 2026-08-16; the
  description must match the actual output, per the tester finding)
- **Also expected** (2026-08-23 discoverability change): the raw-pair
  descriptions state the REAL access model — unknown-family passthrough
  bounded by OAuth scopes, Docs/Sheets `:batchUpdate` on Read & Write files,
  creation via POST `v1/documents` / `v4/spreadsheets` with auto-grant, batch
  denied, DELETE never. They must NOT claim "other Google APIs are denied"
  (stale pre-2026-08-19 posture), and — since the 2026-08-30 allow-by-default
  change — must NOT claim "the only supported Gmail write is messages/send":
  `google_api_modify`'s description must say Gmail mailbox writes (labels,
  drafts, modify, trash/untrash, batchModify, insert/import) are allowed by
  default, that BOTH messages/send and drafts/send ride the send whitelist,
  and that settings writes and permanent deletion are the exceptions.

### A2: Raw Gmail read succeeds
- `google_api_get` with path `gmail/v1/users/me/messages?maxResults=2`
- **Expected**: Real Gmail message list JSON (ids), no error

### A3: Unknown Google API passes through with classification
- `google_api_get` with path `drive/v3/files`
- **Expected**: The call is forwarded to Google with the account's token
  (2026-08-19 posture change: classify, not block — Google's OAuth scopes are
  the backstop). With the standard grant, drive.file limits results to
  picked/app-created files. The `$mcp_tool_call` event carries
  `raw_api_passthrough: true` and `raw_api_family: 'drive/v3'`.
- **Analytics note**: since the raw-api-classification change, EVERY raw call
  (not just passthroughs) stamps `raw_api_kind` / `raw_api_family` /
  `raw_api_endpoint` / `raw_api_mutating` — the event-side assertions live in
  capability 16 A9.
- **No longer passthrough**: the `documents` family graduated to enforced
  per-document rules when Google Docs support landed — a raw
  `v1/documents/<id>` call must be FGAC-classified (capability 19 A6), never
  `raw_api_passthrough`. Sheets and Docs are both enforced families now.
- **Comments carve-out (2026-08-23)**: `drive/v3/files/<id>/comments` (and
  `/replies`) classify as `file_comments` and inherit the file's per-file
  rule — a comment write on a read-only or blocked doc/sheet is denied, and
  the event carries `raw_api_family: 'drive_comments'`, never
  `raw_api_passthrough`. Bare `drive/v3/files` (no comments segment) remains
  passthrough as asserted above.
- **Bare Drive spelling (2026-08-31)**: `v3/files/…` without the `drive/`
  prefix canonicalizes to `drive/v3/…` before classification and routing
  (mirroring the accepted `v4/spreadsheets` / `v1/documents` / mis-routed
  `v1/presentations` spellings) — so `v3/files/<id>/comments` classifies as
  `file_comments`, is enforced per-file, and reaches
  `www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/…` instead of 404ing on a nonexistent path.
  The stamped `raw_api_endpoint` shows the canonical spelling.

### A4: Non-send Gmail mailbox writes are allowed by default
- `google_api_modify` POST to `gmail/v1/users/me/messages/<real-id>/modify`
  with body `{"removeLabelIds":["UNREAD"]}` (use a real id from `gmail_list`);
  then POST `gmail/v1/users/me/labels` with body
  `{"name":"QA allow-by-default"}`; then POST
  `gmail/v1/users/me/messages/batchModify` with body
  `{"ids":["<real-id>"],"addLabelIds":["<new-label-id>"]}`
- **Expected** (2026-08-30 posture change — empower, don't block): all three
  succeed with real Gmail JSON — the message is marked read, the label
  exists, batchModify applies it (`batchModify` is a bulk-label endpoint,
  NOT an HTTP batch multiplexer, and must not hit the batch denial). Each
  call's `$mcp_tool_call` event carries `raw_api_kind: 'gmail_write'`,
  `raw_api_family: 'gmail'`, `raw_api_mutating: true`, and an id-stripped
  `raw_api_endpoint` (e.g. `POST gmail/v1/users/me/messages/{id}/modify`,
  `POST gmail/v1/users/me/messages/batchModify`). Clean up: delete the QA
  label via the Gmail UI or leave it (harmless); `messages/<id>/trash` +
  `untrash` may be used as an extra reversible-write probe.

### A5: Raw send to non-whitelisted recipient is denied
- `google_api_modify` to `gmail/v1/users/me/messages/send` with a base64url
  RFC 2822 `raw` body addressed to `blocked@untrusted.com`
- **Expected**: Unauthorized-recipient denial (recipient parsed out of the
  raw message); nothing is sent

### A6: Raw send to whitelisted recipient succeeds
- `google_api_modify` to `gmail/v1/users/me/messages/send` with a `raw` body
  addressed to a whitelisted address (e.g. `USER_B_EMAIL`)
- **Expected**: Gmail returns a real message id; the mail is actually sent

### A7: Raw send with unparseable recipients is denied
- `google_api_modify` to `gmail/v1/users/me/messages/send` with a body that
  has no parseable To/Cc/Bcc (e.g. `{"raw": "!!!"}` or a missing `raw`)
- **Expected**: Denied with a could-not-determine-recipients message (deny on
  parse failure, never forward blind)

### A8: Raw Sheets write honors per-spreadsheet rules
- `google_api_modify` PUT to
  `v4/spreadsheets/<exposed-id>/values/<range>?valueInputOption=USER_ENTERED`
- **Expected**: Succeeds when the spreadsheet's rule is Read & Write; denied
  with the read-only message when the rule is Read Only (toggle via dashboard
  UI, as in capability 09 A8)

### A9: Batch is denied (and monitored); sheet creation is allowed and auto-granted
- `google_api_modify` with path `batch/gmail/v1`; and `google_api_modify`
  POST with path `v4/spreadsheets` with body `{"properties":{"title":"QA created sheet"}}`
- **Expected**: Batch is denied (it could smuggle sub-requests past the send
  whitelist and read restrictions) and the attempt is stamped
  `denial_code: 'raw_api_batch_unsupported'` for demand monitoring. The
  spreadsheet creation SUCCEEDS (2026-08-19 posture change), returns the new
  spreadsheet JSON, auto-creates a read & write rule for the new id scoped to
  the calling key (visible in dashboard rules as "Agent-created: …"), and a
  follow-up `sheets_read_range` on the new id succeeds without any approval
  link. An `agent_sheet_created` event fires with `auto_granted: true`.

### A10: Raw fallback is discoverable at every decision point
- Call `initialize` and `tools/list` on the hosted MCP endpoint; then a
  successful `sheets_update_range` on a Read & Write fixture.
- **Expected**: the `initialize` result carries a server `instructions` block
  naming `google_api_get` / `google_api_modify` as the full-surface fallback,
  the `docs_edit`/`sheets_edit` batchUpdate tools, the comments pair, and the
  denial → approval-link pattern. Every convenience tool with a superset
  names its fallback in its description (`gmail_list`/`gmail_read` →
  `google_api_get`; `gmail_send` → `google_api_modify`;
  `sheets_update_range`/`sheets_append_rows` → `sheets_edit`;
  `docs_read_document` → `docs_edit`; `docs_edit`/`sheets_edit` →
  `google_api_modify`), lint-enforced by `scripts/mcp-tool-lint.ts`. The
  sheets values write success carries an `fgac_hint` pointing at
  `sheets_edit`. `docs_append_text` and `docs_replace_text` are ABSENT from
  `tools/list` (removed 2026-08-23; `docs_edit` replaces them). Rationale:
  2026-08-23 field failure — an agent shipped a pipe-character text table
  because nothing at its decision point referenced the raw fallback.

### A11: drafts/send rides the send whitelist via server-side recipient resolution
- Create a draft addressed to `blocked@untrusted.com`:
  `google_api_modify` POST `gmail/v1/users/me/drafts` with body
  `{"message":{"raw":"<base64url RFC 2822 to blocked@untrusted.com>"}}`
  (the create itself must SUCCEED — drafting is a plain mailbox write).
  Then `google_api_modify` POST `gmail/v1/users/me/drafts/send` with body
  `{"id":"<draftId>"}`.
- **Expected**: the send is DENIED with the unauthorized-recipient message
  and approval links — the recipients came from the STORED draft (they are
  not in the drafts/send request body), proving server-side resolution.
  Nothing is sent. Repeat with a draft addressed to a whitelisted recipient
  (e.g. `USER_B_EMAIL`): drafts/send SUCCEEDS and the mail arrives.
  A drafts/send with a missing or bogus draft id is denied with an FGAC
  message saying the draft/its recipients could not be determined and
  nothing was sent (for a bogus id the message may quote Google's 404 as the
  fetch-failure detail, but it must read as a refused send, not a bare
  passthrough error) — deny on unresolvable recipients, never forward
  blind. Resolution-failure denials carry NO approval link (the remedy is
  the draft id, not a whitelist grant).

### A12: The two remaining Gmail write refusals are honest about their cause
- `google_api_modify` PATCH `gmail/v1/users/me/settings/sendAs/<any>` with
  body `{"displayName":"QA"}`; and `google_api_modify` POST
  `gmail/v1/users/me/messages/batchDelete` with body `{"ids":["x"]}`
- **Expected**: the settings write is refused with a message naming the REAL
  cause — Google `gmail.settings.*` scopes FGAC's grant does not include, "a
  Google scope limit, not an FGAC rule" — stamped
  `denial_code: 'gmail_settings_unsupported'`; it must NOT read as an FGAC
  policy denial and must NOT mint an approval link. batchDelete is refused
  as permanent deletion with trash named as the reversible alternative,
  stamped `denial_code: 'gmail_write_unsupported'` (that code now means ONLY
  permanent deletion). Settings READS (GET `settings/sendAs`) still succeed.
