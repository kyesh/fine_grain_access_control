# Capabilities — Assertion Checklists

> **These are NOT standalone tests.** They define WHAT to verify, not HOW.
> Each assertion is executed through an agent interface doc in `agents/` or `production/`.

## How to Use

1. Each capability doc lists assertions with expected outcomes.
2. Agent docs (`agents/01_hosted_mcp.md`, etc.) describe how to execute these assertions in a specific runtime.
3. Every agent doc must cover every capability.
4. When adding a new capability file here, update ALL agent docs to cover it.
