# Product Analytics (PostHog)

How FGAC.ai instruments usage, how PostHog persons map to Clerk users, and how to
keep internal/QA traffic out of the numbers.

## Identity model

- **Distinct id = Clerk user id, everywhere.** The dashboard calls
  `posthog.identify(clerkUserId)` on sign-in (`src/app/PostHogIdentify.tsx`); the
  MCP server, API proxy, and Clerk webhook capture server-side events with the
  same id (`src/lib/posthogServer.ts`). One PostHog person per Clerk user, with
  `email`/`name` person properties.
- Signed-out visitors stay anonymous (`person_profiles: 'identified_only'`).
  `posthog.reset()` runs on sign-out so shared browsers don't cross-link users.

## Event catalog

| Event | Source | Key properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$pageview` | client (`PostHogPageView.tsx`) | `$current_url` |
| `sign_up_started` | client (`SignUpCta.tsx`, all sign-up CTAs) | `cta_location`: nav / hero / bottom_cta |
| `sign_up_completed` | server (Clerk webhook, `user.created`) | `$set.email` |
| `mcp_tool_call` | server (`/api/mcp`, every tool) | `tool`, `client_id`, `outcome`, `duration_ms` |
| `proxy_request` | server (`/api/proxy/[...path]`) | `service` (gmail/sheets/drive), `method`, `status`, `outcome`, `duration_ms`, `proxy_key_id` |

`mcp_tool_call.outcome`: `success`, `denied_by_policy` (🚫 FGAC rule), `pending_approval`
(⏳ connection not yet approved), `failed` (❌ auth/input problems), `error`
(upstream Google failure), `exception`.
Unauthenticated calls attribute to the `anonymous-mcp` / `anonymous-proxy` persons.

Every event (client and server) carries an `environment` property:
`development` (localhost), `preview` (`*.vercel.app`), or `production` — all three
Vercel environments share one PostHog project, so filter on it.

## Sign-up funnel / abandoned sign-ups

Create a PostHog funnel insight: `sign_up_started` → `sign_up_completed`
(conversion window ~1 hour). Drop-off = people who opened the Clerk modal but never
finished (the modal + Google OAuth steps in between are Clerk-internal and not
individually observable). The anonymous click merges into the identified person
once the new user's first signed-in page load calls `identify`.

**Required Clerk dashboard config** (both dev and prod instances): the webhook
endpoint `/api/webhooks/clerk` must be subscribed to `user.created` in addition to
`user.deleted`.

## Separating QA/internal traffic from genuine traffic

1. **Filter every insight to `environment = production`.** This removes all local
   dev-server and preview-deployment traffic (the bulk of QA volume).
2. **Create a cohort "Internal / QA"**: persons where `email` is any of the QA test
   accounts or founder accounts (the emails live in 1Password /
   `.qa_test_emails.json`; they are deliberately not listed in this public repo).
   Exclude the cohort from dashboards. This catches QA runs against production.
3. **Historical events (before this instrumentation)** are anonymous and cannot be
   retro-identified. To triage a past traffic spike, break `$pageview` down by
   `$host`: `localhost:3000` and `*.vercel.app` volume is QA by definition; only
   the production-domain remainder is potentially genuine.

## Implementation notes

- Server capture is fire-and-forget: `captureServerEvent()` no-ops when
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`/`_HOST` are unset and flushes via Next's `after()` so
  serverless responses aren't delayed and events aren't dropped.
- MCP instrumentation wraps `server.registerTool` once (see `/api/mcp/route.ts`),
  so newly added tools are instrumented automatically.
- The proxy records `proxy_key_id` (the row's UUID) — never the `sk_proxy_` secret.
