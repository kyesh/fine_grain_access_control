# Product Analytics (PostHog)

How FGAC.ai instruments usage, how PostHog persons map to Clerk users, and how to
keep internal/QA traffic out of the numbers.

## Identity model

- **Distinct id = Clerk user id, everywhere.** The dashboard calls
  `posthog.identify(clerkUserId)` on sign-in (`src/app/PostHogIdentify.tsx`); the
  MCP server, API proxy, and Clerk webhook capture server-side events with the
  same id (`src/lib/posthogServer.ts`). One PostHog person per Clerk user, with
  `email`/`name` person properties.
- Signed-out visitors stay anonymous (`person_profiles: 'identified_only'`).
  `posthog.reset()` runs on sign-out so shared browsers don't cross-link users.
- **`signup_source` person property** (`$set_once`): fresh accounts (<10 min
  old) are stamped `website` on their first identified dashboard visit
  (`PostHogIdentify`) or `claude_connector` on their first MCP connection —
  whichever touchpoint a new account reaches first wins.
- **Delegation observability**: tool/proxy events carry `account_email` and
  `account_delegated` (which mailbox a call resolved to, own vs delegated) via
  `src/lib/toolCallContext.ts` (AsyncLocalStorage rides the props from account
  resolution to the single capture site).

## Event catalog

| Event | Source | Key properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$pageview` | client (`PostHogPageView.tsx`) | `$current_url` |
| `sign_up_started` | client (`SignUpCta.tsx`, all sign-up CTAs) | `cta_location`: nav / hero / bottom_cta |
| `directory_link_clicked` | client (`DirectoryCta.tsx`, all links to the Claude connectors directory listing) | `cta_location`: announcement_bar / setup_step1 / docs_support / dashboard_connect |
| `flyer_scanned` | server (`/go/[slug]` QR redirect) | `slug`, `slug_known`, `campaign`, `variant`, `channel`, `destination`, `device`, `$raw_user_agent`/`$useragent` (the visitor's UA — without it PostHog's virtual traffic classification marks every scan `$virt_is_bot` / `no_user_agent` and bot-filtered views drop all real scans; added 2026-08-30), `geo_city`/`geo_country` (from Vercel headers; `$geoip_disable` set so the server IP isn't resolved). **Bot-filtered** (link-preview crawlers get the redirect but no event) and captured with a random distinct id per scan — `count()` is scans, not people. Joins to the web funnel via `utm_content`/`ref` = slug on the landing `$pageview`. Links managed via `npm run links` (`scripts/short-links.ts`); per-slug running totals also live in the `short_links.scan_count` column |
| `sign_up_completed` | server (Clerk webhook, `user.created`) | `$set.email` |
| `sign_in_completed` | client (`SignInTelemetry.tsx`, dashboard pages) | `gmail_scope`, `drive_file_scope`, `needs_drive_file` (user has Sheets/Docs rules), `drive_file_narrowed` (= needs it and arrived without it). Once per Clerk `lastSignInAt` (localStorage-keyed; fires only within 10 min of the sign-in). Added 2026-09-04: PostHog had no sign-in signal, and a plain Google sign-in rewrites Clerk's grant with the sign-in scope set — no `drive.file` — so `drive_file_narrowed` is the per-sign-in count of users whose Sheets/Docs access a sign-in just broke. Detection query: monitoring.md §7.12 |
| `video_played` | client (`TrackedVideoEmbed.tsx`, all Descript demo embeds) | `video_id`, `video_title`, `page` |
| `$mcp_tool_call` | server (`/api/mcp`, every tool) | `$mcp_tool_name`, `$mcp_duration_ms`, `$mcp_is_error`, `client_id`, `client_name`, `user_agent`, `outcome`, `account_email`, `account_delegated`; raw tools add `raw_api_kind`, `raw_api_family`, `raw_api_endpoint`, `raw_api_mutating`; denials add `denial_code`, and denials carrying an approval link add `approval_request_id` (joins to the approval funnel); failures add `error_status`, `error_reason`, `error_domain`, `failure_reason`, `gmail_404_site`; per-file sheets/docs calls add `file_id` + `file_service` (stamped in `checkFilePermission`, so every typed sheets/docs tool, comments tool, and raw per-file API call carries them — denied outcomes included — making per-file time-to-first-success queryable and joining to `rule_saved.file_id`); `gmail_get_attachment` adds `attachment_selector` and, on 404 recovery paths, `attachment_selfheal`; windowed reads (`gmail_get_attachment`, `gmail_read`, `docs_read_document`, `sheets_get_spreadsheet`, `sheets_read_range`, `google_api_get`) add `window_offset`, `window_chars`, `window_total_chars`; calls that reach Google add `google_ms` (cumulative wall-clock inside `googleFetch`) and `token_ms` (Clerk token fetch) |
| `proxy_request` | server (`/api/proxy/[...path]`) | `service` (gmail/sheets/drive), `method`, `status`, `outcome` (`success`/`auth_failed`/`denied`/`timeout`/`error`), `duration_ms`, `proxy_key_id`, `account_email`, `account_delegated`, `google_ms`, `token_ms`; upstream failures add `error_status` (`timeout`/`network`) |
| `mcp_connection_created` | server (`/api/mcp` auth layer) | `connection_id`, `client_id`, `client_name`/`client_version` (from MCP `initialize` clientInfo, when the creating request was one — **in practice ~never**: the client's concurrent SSE GET usually wins the row-insert race, so this event fires nameless; measured 0/10 with a name 2026-08-27→29. Use `mcp_connection_client_identified` or person-level `mcp_client_initialize` for client attribution), `auto_attached`, `account_age_seconds` |
| `mcp_connection_client_identified` | server (`/api/mcp` auth layer, backfill-on-touch) | `connection_id`, `client_id`, `client_name`, `client_version`. Fires **once per connection**, on the first initialize that replaces the opaque `client_id` placeholder name — the reliable connection→client-product mapping (join on `connection_id`) |
| `mcp_client_initialize` | server (`/api/mcp` auth layer, every authenticated `initialize`) | `client_name`, `client_version` (the client's self-reported MCP clientInfo), `client_id`, `user_agent`. Once per MCP session — the substrate for the per-product split (Cowork / Claude Code / Claude.ai) |
| `delegation_created` | server (dashboard action) | `delegate_email`, `reactivated` |
| `account_linked` | server (dashboard action) | `target_email`, `delegated`, `via` |
| `approval_link_minted` | server (`/api/mcp` — policy denial, send denial, `request_access`) | `action`, `request_id`, `target_hash`, `mint_count`, `via` (`send_denial`/`request_access`; absent for policy denials). **Fires once per mint ATTEMPT**, so `uniq(request_id)` is demand and `count()` is retry pressure |
| `approval_link_opened` | server (approve-page load, `/dashboard/approve`) | `status` (`fresh`/`already_granted`/`wrong_account`/`invalid`), `request_id` (real id for `wrong_account` — recomputed against the resolved owner; `undefined` only for `invalid`), `action`, `agent_driven`, `user_agent` |
| `approval_link_approved` | server (`actions.ts`, all approval paths) | `action`, `request_id`; per-file grants add `substituted` and `granted_count` |
| `read_restriction_enforced` | server (`/api/mcp`) | `via` (tool name), `restriction` |
| `rule_saved` | server (`reportRuleSave` in dashboard `actions.ts` — manual rule form, `exposeFilesFromPicker`, magic-link `insertFileRule`; `grantFileAccessPOST` in `fileAccessHandlers.ts`) | `mode` (`create`/`update`), `service`, `action_type`, `via` (`dashboard_manual` = manual rule form, Gmail-only in today's UI / `dashboard_picker` = server-action Picker expose (recovery + profile flows) / `grant_api` = the REST grant endpoint — the dashboard's Picker manager AND any API caller, so it is the only reachable seam for a hand-typed sheet/doc id / `magic_link` = approval-page grant), `file_id` (when the rule targets a sheet/doc — the join key to `$mcp_tool_call.file_id`); `dashboard_manual` adds `scoped`, `assigned_keys`, and pattern shape (`pattern_kind`/`pattern_length` — the pattern itself is NEVER sent: send patterns are real addresses); `dashboard_picker` adds `profile_scoped`; `grant_api` adds `assigned_keys` when key syncing was requested; `magic_link` adds `request_id` (joins the approval funnel) |
| `rule_save_failed` | server (dashboard `actions.ts`, manual rule form validation) | `mode`, `service`, `action_type`, `via` (`dashboard_manual`), `reason`, pattern shape props as above |
| `picker_scope_redirect` | client (`useGooglePicker`) | `kind` (`sheet`/`doc`). Fires immediately BEFORE the `drive.file` OAuth consent redirect — the funnel's riskiest hop: a `picker_scope_redirect` with no subsequent `picker_opened` is a user who never came back from consent. Page context via `$pathname` |
| `picker_opened` | client (`useGooglePicker`) | `kind`, `from_oauth_return` (true when the picker auto-reopened after the consent round-trip) |
| `picker_picked` | client (`useGooglePicker`) | `kind`, `count` (files picked) |
| `picker_cancelled` | client (`useGooglePicker`) | `kind` |
| `picker_flow_error` | client (`useGooglePicker`, pre-existing) | `stage`, `message` |
| `google_reconnect_started` / `_returned` / `_verified` / `_incomplete` / `_wrong_account` | client (`ReconnectGoogleButton`, Accounts page) | The reconnect funnel (closed 2026-09-03 — `returned`/`verified` are new; before them, silence after `started` was ambiguous between abandoned consent, a session dropped during the OAuth round-trip, and plain success). `started` {`source`} fires before the consent redirect; `returned` when the page processes `?reconnected=1` (fires even after a mid-flow re-sign-in — the redirect_url chain preserves the param); `verified` when the tokeninfo poll confirms both scopes; `incomplete` {`missing_scopes`} when it does not; `wrong_account` {`intended_for`} when a bound reconnect link is opened by the wrong user. Detection query: monitoring.md §7.8 |
| `sheets_grant_verification` | server (approve-page load via `/api/rules/verify-sheets-access`, approval in `actions.ts`, rule creation in `createRule`/`grantFileAccessPOST`, recovery re-checks) | `result` (`ok`/`missing`/`unknown`), `via` (`link_open`/`magic_link`/`post_approval`/`dashboard_manual`/`grant_api`/`recovery`), `spreadsheet_id`. `grant_api` (and `dashboard_manual`, for direct server-action calls — the manual modal is Gmail-only today) = grant verified at rule birth (the stranded-at-birth case — telemetry only, a Google hiccup never fails rule creation); `recovery` = EVERY recovery-UI re-check, captured regardless of result (attempts that stay `missing` are the funnel's stuck users — before this, only successes were visible via `sheets_grant_recovered`, which still fires on `ok`) |
| `sheets_grant_recovered` | server (`/api/rules/verify-sheets-access`) | `spreadsheet_id` |
| `docs_grant_verification` / `docs_grant_recovered` | server (`/api/rules/verify-docs-access`, approval in `actions.ts`) | docs twins of the sheets grant-funnel events, with `document_id` |
| `google_token_fetch_failed` | server (MCP `getGoogleToken`, proxy `fetchClerkGoogleToken`, `getOwnerGoogleToken`) | `reason` (`refresh_failed` = Clerk 422 cannot-refresh, `clerk_error`, `timeout` = MCP-path Clerk call exceeded 15 s), `via` (`mcp`/`proxy`/`grant_check`), `account_delegated`. The `$mcp_tool_call` event also carries `google_token_error` on affected calls. Added 2026-08-20 after the dev-instance refresh-token loss was found; this is the signal for whether production users hit it too |
| `google_token_identity_fallback` | server (MCP `getGoogleToken`) | `via` (`mcp`). Fires when a key owner's own mailbox is reached through the identity-drift self-heal added in `4b551018` — the target address is not a delegation but IS one of the owner's verified Clerk addresses. Unsampled, and independent of `$mcp_tool_call`, so `uniq(person)` is exactly the drifted population still being rescued; the same call also carries `google_token_identity_fallback: true` on `$mcp_tool_call`. Expected to trend to zero as users self-heal — see docs/monitoring.md 7.4 |
| `google_scope_missing` | server (MCP `gmailScopeDenial` / `driveFileScopeDenial`, proxy Gmail handler) | `via` (`mcp`/`proxy`), `scope` (`gmail` / `drive_file`; absent on pre-2026-08-29 events, all of which are gmail), `account_delegated`. Fires when a call is pre-flight denied because Clerk's granted scopes for the account lack what the surface rides on: Gmail calls need `gmail.modify` / `mail.google.com`; non-Gmail calls (typed sheets_*/docs_*/comments_* tools and raw Sheets/Docs/Slides/Drive paths) need `drive.file` — the "checkbox left unchecked at consent" (or pre-drive.file connection) states, which would 403 on every such call until reconnect. Unsampled and independent of `$mcp_tool_call`, so `uniq(person)` is the size of the locked-out population; the same call carries `google_scope_missing: true` on `$mcp_tool_call` and pre-flight-denies with `denial_code` = `failure_reason` = `'gmail_scope_missing'` / `'drive_file_scope_missing'` (outcome `denied_by_policy` since 2026-09-03; `failed` from 2026-08-28 to then) instead of surfacing Google's 403 (outcome `error`). Added 2026-08-28 after repeated per-user gmail_list 403s; drive_file variant 2026-08-29. Since 2026-09-04 a metadata-based denial is confirmed against Google's tokeninfo before it fires — Clerk's scope record is a cache of the last completed OAuth request, and a plain Google sign-in rewrites it without `drive.file` — and when tokeninfo disagrees the call proceeds with `clerk_scope_cache_stale: true` on `$mcp_tool_call`. Since 2026-09-05 tokeninfo decides in BOTH directions (cached ~once per account per token lifetime): a record that claims a scope the token lacks — a no-consent sign-in over a narrow refresh token — is denied as usual and stamps `clerk_scope_record_overstates: true`; monitoring.md §7.12a |
| `mcp_auth_attempt` | server (`/api/mcp` `verifyMcpAuth`) | `outcome` (`ok`/`invalid_token`/`no_token`), `client_id`, `strategy_used` (`clerk`/`direct`/`none`), `memo_hit`, `optimizations_enabled`, `success_sample_rate`, `error_class`, `kid` (on `invalid_token` only), `method`. Auth-health substrate for the JWKS/strategy optimizations. **Failures are unsampled; successes are a 1-in-20 per-request sample** — multiply `ok` by 20 for volume, valid only from the 2026-08-25 fix onward (two earlier versions sampled per-token and were biased; see docs/monitoring.md 1). `kid = 'probe'` marks our own synthetic probes, not users |
| `agent_doc_created` | server (`/api/mcp`, raw `POST v1/documents`) | `document_id`, `auto_granted` (docs twin of `agent_sheet_created`) |
| `connector_install_started` | server (`.well-known` OAuth discovery routes, `/api/mcp` auth layer) | `touchpoint` (`oauth_discovery`/`mcp_401`), `endpoint`, `reason` (`no_token`/`invalid_token`), `method`, `user_agent`, `install_fingerprint` (salted sha256 of ip+user-agent — the uniqueness key; see funnel note below), `client_name`/`client_version` (mcp_401 only, when the unauthenticated request was an MCP `initialize`) |

### The approval funnel: count REQUESTS, not links

**An approval request is one `request_id`. Mint events per `request_id` are
retries, not demand.**

`request_id` is a deterministic HMAC of (user, proxy key, action, target), so
denying the same operation repeatedly re-emits the SAME id and the same URL.
Join `approval_link_minted` → `approval_link_opened` → `approval_link_approved`
on it, and count `uniq(request_id)` at every stage.

This is the definition the funnel lacked before 2026-08-25, and its absence was
expensive. The old `link_id` was a per-mint JWT `jti`, so every agent retry
produced a new id and looked like fresh unopened demand. The same 14-day window
read as **31% approved** counted per link and **~58%** counted per request;
`sheets_expose`, reported as the worst-converting action at 30.7%, was actually
the best established one at 83.3% because it simply had the most retries
(2.93 links per request). Four separate analyses produced four different
numbers — 26%, 31%, 68%, 58% — purely from choosing different groupings.

Two further cautions when reading this funnel:

- **Report approvals, not opens.** `approval_link_approved` requires a form
  submit on a page naming the grant; it is the only stage that proves a
  deliberate human act. `approval_link_opened` only proves an authenticated
  session rendered the page — measured against client-side pageviews, ~23% of
  approve-page loads were an AI agent rather than a person, which is why
  `agent_driven` now rides on the event.
- **Send denials mint TWO requests** (`send_whitelist` and `send_all`), of
  which a human can only ever open one. Send actions therefore carry roughly
  double the request count of a single-option denial.
- **Server-side events carry no browser user agent**, so PostHog labels every
  `posthog-node` event `Automation` / `$virt_is_bot: true`. That label is a
  capture artifact and says nothing about human involvement — do not filter on
  it. (Control: client-side `$pageview` splits Regular/AI Agent normally.)

**HogQL gotcha:** `properties.status` silently returns NULL on the `events`
table — `status` is shadowed by a table field, so dot access resolves to the
wrong thing. The property IS ingested; read it as
`JSONExtractString(properties, 'status')`. Verified 2026-08-25 after the
dot-access form made a correctly-emitted property look missing on both
production and development events. `action`, `request_id`, `agent_driven` and
`user_agent` are unaffected and work with dot access.

`approval_requests` (Postgres) mirrors this in SQL — one row per request with
`mint_count`, `opened_at`, and `approved_at` — so the same questions are
answerable without the analytics pipeline.

The two `sheets_grant_*` events instrument the **picker-first sheets
approval funnel**: opening a sheets approval link verifies the Google-side
`drive.file` grant (`via=link_open`); `result=missing` puts the Picker +
demo-video step BEFORE the approve button, and the approval itself re-fires
with `via=magic_link`. Picking a different sheet than the agent asked for is
an explicit substitution — `approval_link_approved` then carries
`substituted: true` and `granted_count`, making wrong-agent-id frequency
measurable. `/dashboard/sheets-setup` remains the recovery path for
pre-existing stranded rules (dashboard chips, MCP error links); a verified
re-check there fires `sheets_grant_recovered`. Funnel health =
`link_open{missing}` → `magic_link{ok}` conversion.

**The sheets/docs adoption funnel** (instrumented end to end since the PR #72
salvage, 2026-09): `picker_scope_redirect` → `picker_opened` →
`picker_picked` → `rule_saved{via}` → `*_grant_verification{result=ok}` →
first successful `$mcp_tool_call` carrying that `file_id`. The client picker
events cover the dashboard leg (the consent redirect being the riskiest hop —
`picker_scope_redirect` without a following `picker_opened` is an abandoned
consent); `rule_saved.via` splits the three rule-creation paths
(`dashboard_manual`/`dashboard_picker`/`grant_api`/`magic_link` — the
dashboard Picker leg is `via IN ('dashboard_picker','grant_api')`); the
grant-verification
events say whether Google actually holds the `drive.file` grant (every path,
stranded-at-birth included); and `file_id` on `$mcp_tool_call` closes the
loop — per-file time-to-first-success from pick to working agent call. Join
the server stages on `file_id`; the client stages join per-person per-session
(picker events carry no file id until the pick).

`$mcp_tool_call` uses PostHog's **canonical MCP Analytics schema** (event and
`$mcp_*` property names) so PostHog's built-in MCP views resolve the tool name.
`$mcp_is_error` is true only for upstream failures/exceptions; the finer-grained
FGAC story is in the custom `outcome` property: `success`, `denied_by_policy`
(🚫 FGAC rule), `pending_approval` (⏳ connection not yet approved),
`size_capped` (⚠️ deliberate refusal to return an oversized payload — the tool
worked; before 2026-08-24 this classified as `failed` and inflated
`gmail_get_attachment` error-rate readings), `failed` (❌ auth/input problems — these carry `failure_reason`, see below),
`error` (upstream Google failure), `exception`.
Unauthenticated calls attribute to the `anonymous-mcp` / `anonymous-proxy` persons.

**The `error` vs `failed` vs `denied_by_policy` boundary (2026-09):**
`error` (`$mcp_is_error=true`) means FGAC or Google is unhealthy — 5xx,
`timeout`, `network`, throttling 403s (`usageLimits`), exceptions. `failed`
(`$mcp_is_error=false`) means the caller or user can fix it by acting
differently. The 2026-09-02 demotion moved three Google-guidance results from
`error` to ❌ `failed` (`fileGrantErrorResult`, `gmailNotFoundResult`,
`commentsErrorResult`) on the assumption that the Connector Directory reads
`$mcp_is_error`. **Measured 2026-09-03, that assumption was wrong**: the
directory's published per-tool error rate matches `outcome IN (error, failed)`
(google_api_modify showed 18.3% = error+failed; error alone was ~12%), so ❌
does not keep a result out of the public metric — only refusal-shaped 🚫
results (`denied_by_policy`) are excluded. Accordingly, on 2026-09-03 the
subset that is a *deterministic grant refusal carrying its own remediation*
graduated from ❌ to 🚫: the scope pre-flights (`gmailScopeDenial` /
`driveFileScopeDenial`, `denial_code: 'gmail_scope_missing' /
'drive_file_scope_missing'`, `failure_reason` still stamped for continuity)
and the per-file "not shared with FGAC at Google" 403/404 guidance
(`fileGrantErrorResult`, and id-addressed passthrough 404s, `denial_code:
'file_grant_missing_at_google'`). Stale-id 404s (`gmailNotFoundResult`,
`commentsErrorResult`) stay ❌ `failed`: they are caller-data errors, not
access refusals, and claiming otherwise would game the metric. Internal
observability is unchanged: rows still carry `error_status`, `error_reason`,
`error_domain`, and `gmail_404_site` where applicable. Error-rate trend
queries must not compare across these deploys — split on `outcome` and
date-bound at the deploy windows (2026-09-02 demotion, 2026-09-03 graduation).

**Failure detail (2026-08 grant-race fixes):** every non-OK Google response
adds `error_status` (HTTP status, `network`, or `timeout`) to the
`$mcp_tool_call` event.
Sheets failures whose matching FGAC rule is fresh also carry
`sheets_grant_age_seconds`, and when the post-approval grace retry engaged,
`sheets_grace_retries` + `sheets_grace_recovered` — `recovered=true` volume is
the direct measure of how often the drive.file propagation race would have
surfaced an error to an agent. Google Docs calls carry the same trio under
`docs_grant_age_seconds` / `docs_grace_retries` / `docs_grace_recovered`.

**Google failure reason (gmail-failure-path-telemetry plan, 2026-08-26):**
`error_status` records only the HTTP status, which Google multiplexes across
unrelated conditions — most consequentially 403, which covers both a
missing/revoked OAuth scope and plain throttling. Every non-OK response now
also stamps `error_reason` (Google's `error.errors[0].reason`, e.g.
`rateLimitExceeded`, `insufficientPermissions`, `domainPolicy`) and
`error_domain` (`error.errors[0].domain`, e.g. `usageLimits`) when present.
These are Google-defined enum strings, never customer data. Since the
raw-api-error-quality change (2026-08-29), the extractor also reads the
gRPC-style `error.details[]` ErrorInfo shape that Sheets v4 / Docs v1 /
Slides v1 return (their bodies carry no legacy `errors[]` array — before
this, every error from those APIs landed with a null `error_reason`), and
when no reason enum exists anywhere, `error_reason` falls back to Google's
canonical `error.status` string (`PERMISSION_DENIED`, `NOT_FOUND`). `describeGoogleError`
branches its 403 remediation on them: before this, the 403 text asserted the
scope cause unconditionally and told rate-limited callers to reconnect a
working Google account — advice that is wrong for the whole `usageLimits`
class and that suppressed the retry which would have succeeded. **The
`insufficientPermissions` vs `usageLimits` split in production was unmeasured
when this shipped** (no PostHog query access at the time); `error_reason` is
what makes it measurable.

**Upstream timeout classification (sheets-tool-timeout-errors plan,
2026-08-28):** `googleFetch` aborts any single Google exchange at 50 s
(`GOOGLE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS`) and stamps `error_status: 'timeout'`. Before
this, a hung Google call ran into the route's 60 s `maxDuration` and Vercel
killed the function — which also destroyed the `$mcp_tool_call` capture (it
fires on handler completion, flushed in `after()`), so genuine upstream
timeouts were **invisible in PostHog**: the 2026-08-27 user-reported Sheets
timeouts left zero server-side telemetry. The 50 s bound comes from 30 days
of production durations: every tool's p99 ≤ ~13 s, but the 2026-08-23
Google slowdown produced reads that stalled 42–59 s and then succeeded, so
a tighter bound (e.g. 25 s) would have failed 11 calls that recovered.
`google_ms` (cumulative time inside `googleFetch`, summed across grace
retries) and `token_ms` (Clerk token fetch, bounded at 15 s) split
`$mcp_duration_ms` into Google-time vs FGAC-time, so "was Google slow?" is
answerable per call: `google_ms ≈ $mcp_duration_ms` means yes.

The proxy path gets the same treatment (shared constants in
`src/lib/upstreamTimeouts.ts`): its Google exchange is bounded at 50 s
(timeout → HTTP 504, `outcome: 'timeout'`, `error_status: 'timeout'`;
unreachable → 502, `error_status: 'network'`), its Clerk token fetch at
15 s, and `proxy_request` carries `google_ms` / `token_ms`. The proxy route
also now exports `maxDuration = 60` — it previously ran at the platform
default (≤ 15 s), so a slow-but-recoverable Google call died at the function
kill before any 50 s bound could matter.

`gmail_get_attachment` issues two requests — the parent message read, then the
attachment read — and both used to return the same generic "check the ID"
404. `gmail_404_site` (`message` | `attachment`) records which one failed.
`attachment` is the informative value: it means the parent read *succeeded*,
so the `messageId` is valid and the `attachmentId` is stale — the recoverable
case, since Gmail re-issues attachment ids when a message is re-indexed. This
property is the direct measure of open question "what is behind the
gmail_get_attachment 404s".

Since the attachment-selfheal change (2026-08-28), the server recovers that
case itself: the handler already holds a fresh parent read, so on an
attachment 404 — or a 400 (`Invalid attachment token`, Google's response to a
malformed/truncated id; measured against production 2026-08-28) — it
re-resolves against the parent's current attachment list and retries once when
the message has exactly one attachment.
`attachment_selfheal` records the branch — `recovered` (stale id healed,
outcome is success; the row still carries the first fetch's
`error_status: 404` or `400`), `retry_failed` (fresh id also failed), `ambiguous`
(several attachments; the error lists the current ids so recovery is one
retry), `no_attachments` (the id belongs to some other message).
`attachment_selector` (`id` | `filename`) says how the caller identified the
attachment — the new `filename` parameter resolves against the fresh parent
and cannot go stale, so a rising `filename` share is agents adopting the
robust path. Post-deploy confirmation query: breakdown of
`attachment_selfheal` for `tool = 'gmail_get_attachment'`, external users;
the fix is working if `recovered` absorbs the bulk of former 404 errors and
the tool's error rate converges toward the other Gmail read tools.

**Account-resolution failures (`failure_reason`):** `resolveAccountAndToken`'s
four failure branches (`no_proxy_key`, `no_accessible_accounts`,
`account_not_permitted`, `google_token_unavailable`) return ❌ text without
ever reaching Google, so they carry no `error_status` and which branch fired
used to be unrecoverable — the `outcome='failed'` blind class.
`failure_reason` names the branch.

**Response-size monitoring (google-docs-support plan v5, D7 — monitoring
only, no caps):** every `$mcp_tool_call` event carries `response_chars` and
`response_kb`, the serialized size of the tool result FGAC returned. MCP
clients impose their own tool-result budgets (Claude Code rejects results
over ~25k tokens), so a server-side "success" can be silently discarded
client-side. The confirmation question these props exist to answer: what
fraction of successful reads exceed ~25k tokens' worth of chars for
`client_name`-identified Claude Code connections, and do those calls
correlate with abandoned tool sequences? If material, per-kind caps with
recovery guidance get built (Phase 6 of the plan) with thresholds calibrated
from this distribution. `gmail_get_attachment` additionally carries
`attachment_chars`/`attachment_kb` on EVERY outcome that reaches the
attachment fetch — including the over-cap ⚠️ refusal (`outcome=size_capped`
since 2026-08-24), where the generic props only see the short refusal
message, so these are the only record of the actual size that triggered the
cap. Events where the attachment fetch itself failed can't carry a measured
size; those instead carry `attachment_declared_kb`, the size declared in the
parent message's MIME metadata (stamped before the fetch), so error rows are
still attributable to size vs genuine upstream failure. (These
two props were documented ahead of the code: the original commit `5aa23bd`
was stranded on an unmerged branch and the props first ship with the
raw-api-classification change, 2026-08-21.) The pre-existing 200k-char cap
is unchanged.

**Windowed large responses (gmail-attachment-pagination plan v3):** the
2026-08 size-capped demand was bimodal — 8 of 11 external `size_capped` rows
were 215–331 KB documents (barely over the cap), 3 were 1.8–17.5 MB. Rather
than the server guessing (extraction, fixed chunk sizes), the pattern is
caller-directed windowing: `offset` + `limit` params on every read tool with a
potentially-oversized payload — the agent sizes windows to its *own* harness's
tool-result budget. Windows are plain substrings (base64url data for
`gmail_get_attachment`; the serialized response for `gmail_read` — body
untruncated when windowed — `docs_read_document`, `sheets_get_spreadsheet`,
`sheets_read_range`, and `google_api_get`) inside a uniform envelope
(`total_chars`, `next_offset`), so contiguous windows concatenate to exactly
the original payload. Deliberately NOT windowed: tools with native Google
pagination (`gmail_list`, `comments_read`), small bounded reads, and all
write tools (re-issuing a write to page its response would repeat the side
effect). The ⚠️ `size_capped` refusal
remains for over-cap attachment calls that pass no window params, stays
non-`isError`, and names the continuation. Windowed calls stamp
`window_offset`, `window_chars`, `window_total_chars`. Confirmation queries:
external `size_capped` events should be followed (same user, minutes) by
windowed calls rather than silence; `window_total_chars` distribution sizes
real large-payload demand per tool.

**Raw Google API classification (raw-api-classification plan):** every
`google_api_get` / `google_api_modify` call stamps four props at
classification time, denials included — `raw_api_kind` (the
`classifyGoogleApiCall` result: `sheets`, `sheets_create`, `docs`,
`docs_create`, `gmail_read`, `gmail_send`, `gmail_draft_send`, `gmail_write`,
`passthrough`, `denied`),
`raw_api_family` (Google product: `gmail`, `spreadsheets`, `documents`,
`slides`, or the classifier's first-two-segments family for passthroughs;
omitted on denials, which carry `denial_code` — except
`raw_api_family_unsupported` denials, which keep the family so per-family
demand for un-granted APIs stays visible), `raw_api_endpoint` (the HTTP method plus
the **id-stripped** path template from `templateGoogleApiPath`, e.g.
`GET gmail/v1/users/me/messages/{id}` — identifiers are customer data and
high-cardinality, so they never land on events), and `raw_api_mutating`.
Passthrough calls additionally keep `raw_api_passthrough: true`. Raw paths
were never captured before this change, so there is no backfill — coverage
starts at the deploy.

Since raw-api-error-quality (2026-08-29): classification+stamping runs in the
tool handler **before** account resolution, so resolution failures carry the
raw props too (previously they landed with null endpoint/family);
`messages/send` templates literally instead of as `messages/{id}` (new
template value — historical events keep the old one); families FGAC's grant
can never authorize (People, Calendar, Tasks, YouTube, …) are refused
pre-flight with `denial_code: 'raw_api_family_unsupported'` (outcome
`denied_by_policy`, family kept on the event) instead of forwarding to Google
and surfacing an opaque 403/404 error; Slides paths route to
`slides.googleapis.com` as passthrough family `slides` (they previously hit
`www.googleapis.com`, which does not serve Slides, and 404ed unconditionally).

Since gmail-write-allow-by-default (2026-08-30): non-send Gmail writes are no
longer denied — they land as `raw_api_kind: 'gmail_write'` (family `gmail`,
`raw_api_mutating: true`, id-stripped endpoint), which is the demand feed for
the future Gmail-write rule engine. `drafts/send` lands as `gmail_draft_send`
and rides the send whitelist. `denial_code: 'gmail_write_unsupported'` now
means ONLY a permanent-deletion attempt (`messages/batchDelete`) — historical
events with that code (pre-2026-08-30) cover ALL non-send Gmail writes, so
trend queries must not compare across the deploy. New code
`gmail_settings_unsupported` = a Gmail settings write refused for missing
`gmail.settings.*` scopes (family `gmail` kept on both, like the
family-unsupported denials). `messages/batchModify`, `batchDelete`, `insert`,
and `import` are new literal template values (previously `messages/{id}`).

**`client_name`:** populated from the MCP `initialize` handshake's
clientInfo — the auth layer parses it (the only request that carries it in
stateless streamable HTTP; see `src/lib/mcpClientSignals.ts`), stores it on
`agent_connections.client_name` at creation, and backfills rows still holding
the opaque `client_id` placeholder on their next initialize (that backfill
also fires `mcp_connection_client_identified`, since the creating request is
in practice never the initialize POST and `mcp_connection_created` therefore
fires nameless). It then rides on
every `$mcp_tool_call` (via `requireApproval`) alongside `user_agent`, and
`mcp_client_initialize` records it once per session — this is what makes the
per-product split (Cowork / Claude Code / Claude.ai) reproducible. Coverage
starts at the deploy; rows for clients that never re-initialize stay opaque.
Capturing DCR `client_name` at OAuth registration remains a possible
supplement.

**`connector_install_started`: count `uniq(install_fingerprint)`, never raw
events.** It fires anonymously (distinct_id `anonymous-mcp`) from the only
FGAC-owned touchpoints that exist before a Clerk account: the OAuth discovery
endpoints (`touchpoint=oauth_discovery`, recurs on reconnects) and
unauthenticated MCP requests (`touchpoint=mcp_401`). The mcp_401 emission is
**per-request identical to `mcp_auth_attempt` failures by construction**
(same `!authInfo` path in `verifyMcpAuth`; `reason` ≡ `outcome`), so raw
event counts are 401/retry volume — an established client with an expired
token can emit dozens of "installs" a day, which is exactly the artifact
that made install→signup conversion look like it collapsed in late August
2026. `install_fingerprint` (salted sha256 of ip+user-agent; salt =
`ANALYTICS_FINGERPRINT_SALT`, falling back to `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`) is the
uniqueness key: unique installers per day ≈
`uniq(properties.install_fingerprint)` filtered to `reason='no_token'` and
`method='POST'`, and Clerk-step abandonment compares that against
`mcp_connection_created`. Coverage starts at the fingerprint deploy
(2026-08-27); earlier data supports no unique-count reading at all. Filter
obvious crawlers by `user_agent`. Rotating the salt resets fingerprint
continuity — compare uniques only within one salt era.

Payload capture is deliberately **off**: we never send `$mcp_parameters` or
`$mcp_response` (they would carry customer mail/sheet content into PostHog).
For the same reason, do not adopt `@posthog/mcp` / `npx @posthog/wizard
mcp-analytics`, which captures both with no redaction option.

Every event (client and server) carries an `environment` property:
`development` (localhost), `preview` (`*.vercel.app`), or `production` — all three
Vercel environments share one PostHog project, so filter on it.

## Sign-up funnel / abandoned sign-ups

Create a PostHog funnel insight: `sign_up_started` → `sign_up_completed`
(conversion window ~1 hour). Drop-off = people who opened the Clerk modal but never
finished (the modal + Google OAuth steps in between are Clerk-internal and not
individually observable). The anonymous click merges into the identified person
once the new user's first signed-in page load calls `identify`.

**Required Clerk dashboard config** (both dev and prod instances): the webhook
endpoint `/api/webhooks/clerk` must be subscribed to `user.created` in addition to
`user.deleted`.

## Separating QA/internal traffic from genuine traffic

1. **Filter every insight to `environment = production`.** This removes all local
   dev-server and preview-deployment traffic (the bulk of QA volume).
2. **Create a cohort "Internal / QA"**: persons where `email` is any of the QA test
   accounts or founder accounts (the emails live in 1Password /
   `.qa_test_emails.json`; they are deliberately not listed in this public repo).
   Exclude the cohort from dashboards. This catches QA runs against production.
3. **Historical events (before this instrumentation)** are anonymous and cannot be
   retro-identified. To triage a past traffic spike, break `$pageview` down by
   `$host`: `localhost:3000` and `*.vercel.app` volume is QA by definition; only
   the production-domain remainder is potentially genuine.

## Implementation notes

- Server capture is fire-and-forget: `captureServerEvent()` no-ops when
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`/`_HOST` are unset and flushes via Next's `after()` so
  serverless responses aren't delayed and events aren't dropped.
- MCP instrumentation wraps `server.registerTool` once (see `/api/mcp/route.ts`),
  so newly added tools are instrumented automatically.
- Video plays: Descript embeds implement the player.js (Embedly) protocol and
  also post a bare `descript:embed:played` string to the parent window on
  play (verified empirically 2026-08). `TrackedVideoEmbed` listens for either,
  scoped per-iframe via `event.source`, and captures `video_played` once per
  mount. New demo videos must use `TrackedVideoEmbed`, not a raw `<iframe>`.
- The proxy records `proxy_key_id` (the row's UUID) — never the `sk_proxy_` secret.
