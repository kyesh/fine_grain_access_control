/* ─── Sheets setup / grant recovery ──────────────────────────────────────
   The landing spot whenever a sheets FGAC rule exists (or was just approved
   via magic link) but Google has no drive.file grant for the spreadsheet —
   the state every connector-launch user stranded in. Walks the user through
   the ONE action that registers the grant (picking the sheet in the Google
   Picker) with the demo video alongside.

   Reached from: the magic-link approve flow (`from=approval`), the
   dashboard's "needs Google access" chip, and the MCP stranded-sheet error.

   The first-time drive.file consent redirect returns to this pathname with
   `autoOpenPicker=true&pickerContext=<sid>` (and nothing else), so the sid
   is restored from pickerContext on that leg. */
