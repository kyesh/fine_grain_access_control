/**
 * MCP tool definitions — names, titles, descriptions, and safety annotations.
 *
 * This module is intentionally pure (no db/env imports) so that
 * `scripts/mcp-tool-lint.ts` can import it and enforce the Anthropic
 * Connectors Directory invariants in CI:
 *   - every tool has a `title` and a readOnlyHint/destructiveHint
 *   - tool names are ≤ 64 characters
 *   - no tool forwards both safe and unsafe HTTP methods
 *   - freeform-path tools name/link the target API in their description
 *   - convenience tools reference their raw-API fallback in the description
 *     (google_api_get / google_api_modify are the full surface; typed tools
 *     are shortcuts — every dead end must point at the escape hatch)
