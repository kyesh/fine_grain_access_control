/**
 * Classification and agent-facing guidance for "Clerk could not hand us a
 * Google access token" — the failure class behind `google_token_fetch_failed`.
 *
 * Pure (no Clerk, no DB, no PostHog) so the MCP route's wording and retry
 * policy are unit-testable: scripts/test-google-token-failure.ts.
 *
 * Why the split between TRANSIENT and DETERMINISTIC matters (measured in
 * production, 30 days to 2026-09-04): every MCP-path token failure in that
 * window was `clerk_error`, and the one account that produced one per day
 * was HEALTHY — its agent fires two calls on the same delegated mailbox
 * within ~100 ms on its first touch of the day, one of them fails at Clerk
 * in ~80-120 ms, the other succeeds, and every later call on that mailbox
 * succeeds. A "reconnect your account" refusal there would be a daily false
 * alarm aimed at a user whose grant is fine. So: unknown Clerk errors are
 * retried once server-side and, if they still fail, get hedged
 * retry-then-reconnect guidance as a ❌ failure; only the states that cannot
 * clear on their own (no grant stored at all, Clerk cannot refresh) get the
 * 🚫 stop-and-reconnect refusal.
 *
 * The 2026-09-08 lesson: "unknown Clerk error" must not swallow a KNOWN
 * dead-grant code. Clerk's 400 `oauth_token_retrieval_error` ("Failed to
 * retrieve a new access token from the OAuth provider") is Clerk relaying
 * Google's refusal to refresh; every production instance inspected on
 * 2026-09-09 (three accounts, raw Backend API) carried Google's
 * `invalid_grant "Token has been expired or revoked."`, no account recovered
 * on its own, and the retry had recovered nothing since it shipped. Falling
 * through to `clerk_error` meant a pointless retry, a ❌ "usually temporary"
 * answer, and no reconnect link from list_accounts — 14 identical Sheets
 * failures from one account in two days. That code now classifies
 * `grant_revoked` (deterministic, reconnect repairs it).
