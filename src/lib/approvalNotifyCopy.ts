/**
 * Approval-link reminder email — the pure half of out-of-band link delivery.
 * `src/lib/approvalNotify.ts` decides when to send and sends; this module
 * only builds strings, so `scripts/test-approval-notify-copy.ts` can pin
 * them without a database or a mail server.
 *
 * Sender: FGAC's own support mailbox (never the user's Google grant — that
 * grant exists for the user's agent acting at the user's direction, and an
 * FGAC-initiated send through it is a use the user never consented to;
 * decided 2026-09-15). Reply-To is the same mailbox, so "let us know" is a
 * reply.
 *
 * When (Ken, 2026-09-15): only after the agent has asked for the SAME link
 * more than once and the person has still not opened it — the first denial
 * relies on the agent relaying the link; the reminder exists for the case
 * where that visibly did not happen. Never more than a few per person per
 * day, in case an agent asks for many files at once.
 *
 * Every agent-controlled string that reaches a header or the body goes
 * through `sanitizeLine`: CR/LF stripped (header injection), control
 * characters dropped, length capped. Plain text, no HTML.
