/**
 * The scopes a Google access token ACTUALLY carries, from Google's tokeninfo
 * endpoint — as opposed to Clerk's `scopes` metadata, which is a record of
 * the last OAuth request that completed for the account.
 *
 * The two disagree in practice, in both directions (measured 2026-09-04):
 * a plain sign-in on an instance whose scope list lacks drive.file rewrites
 * the record narrower than a later-refreshed token; a sign-in that bounces
 * without consent over a narrow refresh token writes the record WIDER than
 * every token minted after the first refresh. The dashboard (googleAccess.ts)
 * and the Picker token bridge already treat tokeninfo as the truth; the MCP
 * pre-flight does the same here, so the three readers never disagree.
 *
 * Cached per token (in-memory, per function instance) so the check costs
 * about one Google round-trip per account per token lifetime, not one per
 * call. The cache holds only the scope list, never anything it could leak —
 * but the key is the token, so it must never be logged or exposed.
